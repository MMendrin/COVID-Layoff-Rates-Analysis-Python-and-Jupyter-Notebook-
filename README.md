# Python Data Analysis on Layoffs During Covid-19 Pandemic
M. Mendrin

This project looks at layoff data from the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020, to the end of November 2022.
The data used is imported from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022?resource=download&select=layoffs.csv 

Three different questions will be asked and addressed in this project: 

1) Out of the finance, retail, and real estate industry, which had the largest number of employees laid off from March 2020 to November 2020, and which industry had the largest percentage of employees laid off?

2) Was there an increase in the average percentage of company layoffs after Elon Musk announced layoffs for Twitter on November 3rd, 2022, in comparison to the average percentage of all months prior in 2022? If so, by how much, and are these results significant?

3) Was there a greater average percentage of layoffs in 2020 or 2022, and what insights might this difference in percentage reveal about the world in these two years?
